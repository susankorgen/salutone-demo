# salutone-demo
An original, full-stack application, created and coded by Susan Korgen. It showcases product design and planning, health/clinical/scientific UI/UX, a REST API, back end database access, healthcare data interoperability via FHIR, agile project planning, sensitivity to patient concerns, and more. 

This demo balances competing concerns for clinical realism, medical privacy, and a need to demo healthcare data skills, by creating a fiction. The therapeutic approach, data metrics, patients, providers, and protocols for group meetings and care coordination, are fictions. It's a code demo. 

I want to clarify this point out of respect for the medical battles being fought in mental health care every day; my commitment to patient safety in clinical applications; and my affection for online forums with moderators and bots, like reddit r/aww, which have brought real comfort to many people in difficult times.
