# emotone-demo
Professional code example: an original, full-stack application, created and coded by Susan Korgen. It showcases product design, clinical/scientific UI/UX, a REST API, back end database access, healthcare data interoperability via FHIR, agile project planning, sensitivity to patient concerns, and more. This demo balances competing concerns for clinical realism, medical privacy, and a need to demo healthcare data skills, by creating a fiction. 

The therapeutic approach, data metrics, patients, providers, and protocols for group meetings and care coordination, are all fictions.  It's a code demo. Clinically, it has these issues: it has no scientific foundation, it has no proven efficacy, its most interesting tech is too advanced to be safe (it is simulated), and no safety risks were examined during project planning, other than to write this description. I want to clarify this, because of my great respect for the medical battles being fought in mental health care every day, and because of my great affection for online forums like reddit/aww, which have brought real comfort to many people in difficult times.
